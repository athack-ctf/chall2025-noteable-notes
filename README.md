# Chall - Noteable Notes

## Type

- [X] **OFF**line
- [ ] **ON**line

## Designer(s)

- Anthony Andreoli

## Description

Participants must capture the bass pedal notes within the song, and their position in each bar. These 16th note positions yield hex values that, when combined, form the key. Problem is, there are other instruments in the mix, so it's not just about loudness analysis, but over a specific frequency, incorporating the correct window size of 16th notes.

**IMPORTANT:** This description will **NOT** be shared with participants.

# Project Structure

## 1. HACKME.md

- **[HACKME.md](HACKME.md)**: A teaser or description of the challenge to be shared with participants (in CTFd).

## 2. Source Code

- **[source/README.md](source/README.md)**: Sufficient instructions for building your offline artifacts from source
  code. If your project includes multiple subprojects, please consult us (Anis and Hugo).
- **[source/*](source/)**: Your source code.

## 3. Offline Artifacts

- **[offline-artifacts/*](offline-artifacts/)**: All files (properly named) intended for local download by
  participants (e.g., a binary executable for reverse engineering, a custom-encoded image, etc.). For large files (
  exceeding 100 MB), please consult us (Anis and Hugo).

## 4. Solution

- **[solution/README.md](solution/README.md)**: A detailed writeup of the working solution.
- **[solution/FLAGS.md](solution/FLAGS.md)**: A single markdown file listing all (up-to-date) flags.
- **[solution/*](solution/)**: Any additional files or code necessary for constructing a reproducible solution for the
  challenge (e.g., `PoC.py`, `requirement.txt`, etc.).
